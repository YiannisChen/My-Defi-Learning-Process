# ERC-4626 Yield Vault Test Analysis

## Test Process Overview

### Setup (Steps 1-4)
- Deploy Strategy & Vault contracts
- Connect with 80% allocation
- **Expected**: Strategy active = true

### Operations (Steps 5-13)
- User deposits: 50 DAI + 30 DAI = 80 DAI total
- Verify funds split: ~64 DAI in strategy, ~16 DAI in vault
- Test withdrawals, harvesting, rebalancing
- Test pause functionality with limited withdrawals
- **Expected**: All operations complete successfully

### Strategy Management (Steps 14-15)
- Test normal strategy removal → Should fail (funds still present)
