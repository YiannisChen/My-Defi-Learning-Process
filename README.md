# üöÄ My DeFi Learning Journey

Hey! So I'm diving back into Solidity after my initial crash course on WTF Academy. This time I'm following Professor Liang Peili's awesome DeFi videos - he's this blockchain teacher I really look up to from my university.

## üëã What's This All About?

This repo is basically my playground for building DeFi stuff I'm learning from Prof. Liang's course. I'm getting my hands dirty with all the cool protocols:

- Building different types of stablecoins
- Creating yield vaults using ERC-4626
- Setting up my own mini DEXs with AMMs
- Coding staking and reward systems
- Making simple lending protocols

## üìù Projects I'm Working On

| # | Project | What It Is | Where I'm At | Related Lessons |
|---|---------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Stablecoins](./projects/01-stablecoins/) | Different ways to make stable tokens | Completed! ‚úÖ | Lessons 2-3 |
| 2 | [ERC-4626 Vault](./projects/02-erc4626-vault/) | Standard yield vaults | On the to-do list | Lessons 4-5 |
| 3 | [DEX with AMM](./projects/03-dex-amm/) | Uniswap-style exchange | Coming soon | Lessons 6-12 |
| 4 | [Staking Rewards](./projects/04-staking-rewards/) | Stake tokens, earn rewards | Coming soon | Lesson 13 |
| 5 | [Lending Protocol](./projects/05-lending-protocol/) | Borrow and lend stuff | Coming soon | Lesson 19 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech I'm Using

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (obviously!)
- **Dev Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing**: Waffle, Chai, Ethers.js
- **Frontend**: Basic React stuff
- **Deployment**: Sepolia testnet

## üîç More About Each Project

### Stablecoins
I've completed two different flavors of stablecoins:
- **Fiat-backed stablecoin (SimpleDollar)**: Similar to USDT/USDC with centralized issuance
  - ERC20 implementation with 18 decimals
  - Role-based access control (admin, minter, pauser, blacklister)
  - Blacklist functionality for regulatory compliance
  - Pause/unpause capability for emergencies

- **Collateralized stablecoin**: Similar to DAI with ETH collateralization
  - ETH-collateralized with over-collateralization (150%)
  - Price oracle for ETH/USD conversion
  - Vault system with collateralization management
  - Liquidation mechanism (125% threshold with 10% penalty)
  - 1% stability fee implementation

### ERC-4626 Vault
Building standard token vaults with:
- Ways to deposit and withdraw
- Strategies for generating yield
- Based on Lessons 4-5

### DEX with AMM
Creating a simple exchange with:
- x*y=k formula like Uniswap V2
- TWAP oracle for price data
- Flash swap functionality
- Based on Lessons 6-12, 14-17

### Staking Rewards
Setting up a staking system with:
- Time-based rewards
- Proper reward calculations
- Based on Lesson 13

### Lending Protocol
Making a basic lending system with:
- Supply and borrow mechanics
- Different interest rate models
- Based on Lesson 19
