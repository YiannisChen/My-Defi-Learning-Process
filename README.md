# 🚀 My DeFi Learning Journey

Hey! So I'm diving back into Solidity after my initial crash course on WTF Academy. This time I'm following Professor Liang Peili's awesome DeFi videos - he's this blockchain teacher I really look up to from my university.

## 👋 What's This All About?

This repo is basically my playground for building DeFi stuff I'm learning from Prof. Liang's course. I'm getting my hands dirty with all the cool protocols:

- Building different types of stablecoins
- Creating yield vaults using ERC-4626
- Setting up my own mini DEXs with AMMs
- Coding staking and reward systems
- Making simple lending protocols

## 📝 Projects I'm Working On

| # | Project | What It Is | Where I'm At | Related Lessons |
|---|---------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | [Stablecoins](./projects/01-stablecoins/) | Different ways to make stable tokens | Working on it! | Lessons 2-3 |
| 2 | [ERC-4626 Vault](./projects/02-erc4626-vault/) | Standard yield vaults | On the to-do list | Lessons 4-5 |
| 3 | [DEX with AMM](./projects/03-dex-amm/) | Uniswap-style exchange | Coming soon | Lessons 6-12 |
| 4 | [Staking Rewards](./projects/04-staking-rewards/) | Stake tokens, earn rewards | Coming soon | Lesson 13 |
| 5 | [Lending Protocol](./projects/05-lending-protocol/) | Borrow and lend stuff | Coming soon | Lesson 19 |

## 🛠️ Tech I'm Using

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (obviously!)
- **Dev Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing**: Waffle, Chai, Ethers.js
- **Frontend**: Basic React stuff
- **Deployment**: Sepolia testnet

## 🔍 More About Each Project

### Stablecoins
Working on different flavors of stablecoins:
- The centralized kind (like USDT/USDC)
- The collateralized kind (like DAI)
- Based on Lessons 2-3

### ERC-4626 Vault
Building standard token vaults with:
- Ways to deposit and withdraw
- Strategies for generating yield
- Based on Lessons 4-5

### DEX with AMM
Creating a simple exchange with:
- x*y=k formula like Uniswap V2
- TWAP oracle for price data
- Flash swap functionality
- Based on Lessons 6-12, 14-17

### Staking Rewards
Setting up a staking system with:
- Time-based rewards
- Proper reward calculations
- Based on Lesson 13

### Lending Protocol
Making a basic lending system with:
- Supply and borrow mechanics
- Different interest rate models
- Based on Lesson 19
